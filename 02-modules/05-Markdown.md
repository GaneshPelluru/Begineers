# Markdown
             
## Overview
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text documents. Markdown files in GitHub are text files with the .md file extension that use Markdown
syntax to format text.Markdown syntax allows you to add formatting elements to your text,such as headings, bold and italic text, links, images, lists, code blocks, 
and more.
- Markdown files are commonly used in GitHub to create documentation, README files, and other text-based content. GitHub automatically renders Markdown files as HTML,
which makes it easy to view the formatted content directly in your web browser.
- When you create a new file in a GitHub repository, you can choose to create a new Markdown file and GitHub will provide you with a basic template to get started.
You can also edit existing Markdown files directly in the GitHub web interface or by using a text editor on your local machine and then pushing the changes to the 
GitHub repository.

How to create a Markdown file to a project

##To create a Markdown file for a project, you can follow these steps:

    1.Open a text editor or Markdown editor. There are many options available, including Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and many others.

    2.Create a new file by selecting "File" and then "New" or by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+N" or "Cmd+N".

    3.Save the file with a .md extension. For example, you can name the file "README.md". This file will serve as the main documentation for your project.

    4.Begin writing your content using Markdown syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to create headings, lists, 
      links, and other formatting elements. Here are a few examples:

##To create a heading, use one or more hash symbols before the text:
                         shell
                      # Heading 1
                     ## Heading 2
                    ### Heading 3

##To create a list, use an asterisk or a dash before each item:
                       markdown
                       Copy code
                       * Item 1
                       * Item 2
                       * Item 3
##To create a link, use square brackets to enclose the link text and parentheses to enclose the link URL:
                         less
                      Copy code

                         scss
                      Copy code
                     *bold text*
                     italic text
Save your Markdown file when you're finished.

You can now use a Markdown viewer or converter to display your Markdown file as HTML or PDF, or you can simply view the file in a Markdown editor.

  #####Extention of markdown:-
  
  
  There are several extension keywords that can be used in Markdown to enable additional features beyond the basic syntax. Here are a few examples:

 1.Tables:-

   The table extension allows you to create tables in your Markdown document. To use this extension, you need to add a pipe character between each column and use              a hyphen to separate the header row from the content rows.
   
   #creation of Table format:
               - Create and format tables
               - Select a cell within your data.
               - Select Home > Format as Table.
               - Choose a style for your table.
               - In the Create Table dialog box, set your cell range.
               - Mark if your table has headers.
               - Select OK.


2.Task lists:
    The task list extension allows you to create checkboxes in your Markdown document. To use this extension, you need to add a hyphen followed by a space and a pair         of brackets, with a space between the brackets and the text of the task.

3.Footnotes:
    The footnote extension allows you to add footnotes to your Markdown document. To use this extension, you need to add a caret (^) followed by the footnote text in        square brackets, and then add the footnote content at the bottom of the document.

4.Strikethrough:
    The strikethrough extension allows you to add strikethrough text to your Markdown document. To use this extension, you need to surround the text with two tildes (~).

To enable these extensions, you typically need to use a Markdown processor that supports them or add the appropriate configuration to your Markdown tool or application.
