## Overview

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a` markup language` used for `describing` and `exchanging structured data between different systems`. It is a text-based format that is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it a popular choice for data exchange between systems.

XML uses tags to define elements within a document, and attributes to provide additional information about those elements. An XML document consists of a prolog that defines the version of XML being used, the character encoding, and any other information about the document. The prolog is followed by the root element, which contains all other elements within the document.

XML allows for the creation of `custom markup languages` that can be tailored to the specific needs of an application or organization. It also provides a way to validate the structure of a document using `Document Type Definitions (DTDs)` or XML Schemas, ensuring that data is correctly formatted and consistent.

XML is widely used in web services, data exchange, and document formats such as `RSS` feeds, `XHTML`, and `SVG`. It is also commonly used in configuration files for software applications and as a data interchange format for databases.


## What is XML?

- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

- XML was designed to store and transport data.

- XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.


## Why study XML?

- XML plays an important role in many different IT systems.

- XML is often used for distributing data over the Internet.

- It is important (for all types of software developers!) to have a good understanding of XML.


## Example

             <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
             <book>
               <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
               <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
               <publisher>Charles Scribner's Sons</publisher>
               <year>1925</year>
               <price>12.99</price>
             </book>

In this example, the XML document starts with a prolog that specifies the version of XML being used (1.0) and the character encoding (UTF-8). The root element is "book", and it contains child elements for the title, author, publisher, year, and price of the book. Each element is enclosed in angle brackets and is either an opening tag (e.g.`<title>`) or a closing tag (e.g.`</title>`). The text between the opening and closing tags is the value of the element. Attributes can also be included within the opening tag of an element, using the format `attribute="value"`.
