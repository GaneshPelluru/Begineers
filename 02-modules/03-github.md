GITHUB:
GitHub, Inc. (/ˈɡɪthʌb/[a]) is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 372 million repositories,including at least 28 million public repositories. It is the largest source code host as of November 2021.

HISTORY:
Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release. GitHub has an annual keynote called GitHub Universe.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:
GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management). Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.

In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management amid harassment claims made against senior management. Tom Preston-Werner resigned as CEO amid the scandal.

#### WHAT IS GIT HUB:-GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software. It uses the Git version control system to track changes to code over time and enables users to work together on coding projects, contribute to open-source software, and manage code repositories. GitHub also provides a wide range of tools and services to support software development, including issue tracking, project management, continuous integration, and code review.

###SERVICES PROVIDED BY GITHUB:-
GitHub provides a wide range of services for developers and organizations involved in software development, including:
1. Version control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to code over time.
2. Hosting repositories: GitHub hosts remote code repositories where developers can store and share their code with others.
3. Code collaboration: GitHub enables developers to work collaboratively on coding projects by allowing them to share and review code changes, submit pull requests, and    provide feedback on code.
4. Project management: GitHub offers project management tools such as Kanban boards, task lists, and milestones to help teams organize and manage their work.
5. Issue tracking: GitHub provides tools for issue tracking, allowing developers to track bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to their projects.
6. Continuous integration: GitHub supports continuous integration, a software development practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into a        codebase.
7. Code review: GitHub provides tools for code review, allowing developers to review code changes and provide feedback on improvements.
8. Package registry: GitHub offers a package registry for hosting and sharing code packages, libraries, and other dependencies.
9. Security: GitHub provides security features such as vulnerability scanning and code analysis to help developers identify and address security issues in their code.
10.Community: GitHub hosts a large community of developers and open-source projects, providing opportunities for networking, collaboration, and learning.


####GitHub Archive Program-In July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site[56] in an abandoned mountain mine in Svalbard, Norway, part of the Arctic World Archive and not far from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant, but significant public repositories. The 21TB of data was stored on piqlFilm archival film reels as matrix (2D) barcode (Boxing barcode), and is expected to last 500–1,000 years.


#########GIT HUB ACCOUNT:- A GitHub account is a user account on the GitHub platform that allows developers to use the full range of GitHub's features and services.                              With a GitHub account, developers can host and manage their code repositories, collaborate with others on coding projects, and participate                             in the GitHub community.

                          To create a GitHub account, you need to provide your email address, a username, and a password. Once you have created an account, you can                               customize your profile by adding a profile picture, a bio, and links to your social media accounts.
                       
                          With a GitHub account, you can create and manage repositories, collaborate with others by contributing to their projects or inviting them to                           work on yours, track issues and bugs, and participate in discussions on the platform. You can also follow other developers and projects that                           interest you and receive notifications when they make changes or updates.
                       
                          GitHub offers different types of accounts, including free accounts and paid accounts with additional features and services. Free accounts                               allow developers to create public repositories for open-source projects and host them on the platform for free. Paid accounts provide                                   additional features such as private repositories, team management tools, and advanced security features.
                       
                          Overall, a GitHub account is an essential tool for developers and organizations involved in software development, providing a centralized                               platform for version control, collaboration, and project management.
                          

       ###GITHUB PAGES:-As a static web hosting service for blogs, project documentation, and books, GitHub Pages has been available since 2008.

                        Every piece of material on GitHub Pages is kept in a Git repository and is either delivered to visitors verbatim or in Markdown style. The                             Jekyll static website and blog generator is integrated with GitHub, as are the pipelines for continuous integration. Jekyll automatically                               regenerates the website and serves it through the GitHub Pages infrastructure each time the content source is updated.
                        
                        Both free and paid tiers of service are offered, just like the rest of GitHub. Websites created using this service can be connected to custom                           domains purchased through a third-party domain name registrar or hosted as subdomains of the github.io domain. [85] HTTPS encryption is                                 supported by GitHub Pages.

 ###EDUCATION PROGRAM:-GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students over the age of 13 free access to popular development                          tools and services. GitHub partnered with Bitnami, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap, Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid,                        Stripe, Travis CI, and Unreal Engine to launch the program.
                       
                       In 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program[93] to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at                        their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older across the world.[94] GitHub Campus Experts are                        one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and                            additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert applicants must complete an online training course                            consisting of multiple modules designed to grow community leadership skills.
