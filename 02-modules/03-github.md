## HOW TO USE GIT HUB

 GitHub is a popular platform for version control and collaboration on software development projects. Here are some general steps on how to use GitHub:

- `Create an account:` Go to github.com and create a free account.

- `Create a repository:` Once you have an account, you can create a repository by clicking on the "New" button on the left-hand side of your dashboard. Give your repository a name and a brief description, choose whether it should be public or private, and select any other options you want.

- `Add files to your repository:` You can add files to your repository in a number of ways, including uploading files directly to GitHub, using the command line, or using a GUI application. Once your files are in your repository, you can track changes and collaborate with others.

- `Make commits:` Commits are snapshots of changes to your code. You can make commits in a number of ways, such as using the command line or a GUI application. Each commit should have a clear message describing what changes you made.

- `Create branches:` Branches allow you to work on different features or versions of your code without affecting the main branch. You can create branches using the command line or a GUI application.

- `Collaborate with others:` GitHub allows you to collaborate with other developers on your code. You can invite collaborators to your repository and review and merge their changes.

- `Pull requests:` If you want to merge changes from one branch to another, you can create a pull request. This allows other developers to review your changes and give feedback before they are merged.

 These are just some of the basic steps to using GitHub. There are many other features and tools available on the platform, so it's worth exploring and learning more     about them as you become more comfortable with using GitHub.

## ROLE IN CODING

 While GitHub is primarily used by developers and software engineers, there are a few ways it can be used in day-to-day life. Here are some examples:

- Hosting personal projects: GitHub can be used to host personal projects such as portfolios, blogs, and personal websites. By using GitHub Pages, users can host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories.

- Collaborating on non-programming projects: GitHub can also be used to collaborate on non-programming projects such as writing, art, and music. Users can create repositories for their projects and invite collaborators to contribute.

- Managing personal notes and files: GitHub can be used to manage personal notes and files by creating repositories for storing documents, notes, and other important information. By using version control, users can track changes to their files and access previous versions.

- Learning and teaching programming: GitHub can be used as a platform for learning and teaching programming by creating repositories with example code, tutorials, and exercises. Users can also contribute to open source projects to gain experience and learn from other developers.

- Job searching: GitHub can be used by job seekers to showcase their skills and projects to potential employers. Users can create a profile with their resume, link to their repositories, and demonstrate their programming abilities.

- Overall, while GitHub is primarily focused on software development, its features and functionality can be used for a variety of purposes beyond coding

## IMPACT OF GITHUB IN OUR CODES

 GitHub has had a significant impact on the world of coding and software development. Here are some ways in which GitHub has influenced coding:

- Collaboration: GitHub has made it much easier for developers to collaborate on projects. By providing a platform for sharing code, tracking changes, and managing issues, GitHub has made it easier for developers to work together on open source projects.

- Version control: GitHub has made version control accessible to developers of all skill levels. By using Git, developers can track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and roll back changes if needed.

- Community: GitHub has created a community of developers who share their code, ideas, and knowledge. By contributing to open source projects, developers can learn from others and improve their skills.

- Code quality: GitHub has made it easier for developers to maintain high-quality code. By using tools such as continuous integration and code review, developers can catch errors and ensure that their code meets the highest standards.

- Learning: GitHub has made it easier for developers to learn from others. By studying the code of others, developers can learn new techniques, approaches, and best practices.

Overall, GitHub has had a profound impact on the world of coding by making it easier for developers to collaborate, manage their code, and learn from others. The platform has helped to foster a sense of community and has made it easier for developers to create high-quality software.
