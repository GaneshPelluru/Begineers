## Overview

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a `markup language` used for creating `web pages` and other types of `web-based content`. It is the standard language used to `structure content on the web` and provides a way to create `structured documents` by describing their semantic meaning.

- HTML uses a series of tags and attributes to define the structure and content of a web page. HTML tags are used to `mark up different parts of the document`, such as `headings`, `paragraphs`, `images`, and `links`. Attributes provide additional information about the tags and can be used to control the appearance and behavior of elements on the page.

- HTML documents are structured in a `hierarchical manner`, with the `<html>` element at the top of the hierarchy and other elements nested within it. The `<head>` element contains information about the document, such as the `title` and `metadata`, while the `<body>` element contains the main content of the page.

- HTML has evolved over time, with different versions and specifications being released. The current version of `HTML` is `HTML5`, which includes new features such as multimedia support, improved accessibility, and semantic markup.

- In addition to HTML, web development often involves the use of other technologies such as `CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)` for styling web pages and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.


## History

- HTML, which stands for `HyperText Markup Language`, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. The first version of HTML was introduced in `1991` by `Tim Berners-Lee`, a British computer scientist who is considered the inventor of the World Wide Web.

- The first version of HTML was very basic, and only supported a limited set of tags, such as `<h1> for headings` and `<p> for paragraphs`. Over the years, new versions of HTML were released with more features and capabilities.

- In `1995`, `the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)` was founded to develop and maintain web standards. `HTML 2.0` was released in the same year, followed by `HTML 3.2` in `1997`. `HTML 4.0` was released in `1997`, and it introduced a number of new features such as `tables`, `frames`, and `forms`.

- `HTML 4.01` was released in `1999` and was the last version of HTML to be based on `SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)`, a metalanguage used to describe markup languages. In `2000`, the W3C began work on a new version of HTML called `XHTML`, which was based on `XML (Extensible Markup Language)`.

- `XHTML` was designed to be more modular and extensible than HTML, and it was intended to be the future of web development. However, `XHTML` was not widely adopted, and many web developers continued to use `HTML 4.01`.

- In `2004`, the W3C began work on a new version of HTML called `HTML5`. HTML5 was designed to be more `flexible` and `powerful` than previous versions of HTML, and it introduced a number of new features such as `video` and `audio playback`, canvas for drawing, and support for mobile devices.

- HTML5 was officially released in `2014`, and it has since become the standard for web development. Today, HTML is an essential tool for web developers, and it is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of the web.
