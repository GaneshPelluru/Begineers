# `Markdown`
## `OverView`

`Markdown` is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It was created by `John Gruber` and `Aaron Swartz` in `2004` with the goal of making it easy to write and read structured documents without requiring extensive knowledge of HTML or other formatting languages.

Markdown uses simple syntax to indicate :
 * Headings,
 * Emphasis,
 * Links,
 * Images, 
 * Lists,
 * Code blocks and etc..


Here are some examples of Markdown syntax:

 * `Headings`:
 
         Heading 1:
# `Ganesh`   by using # symbol

         Heading 2:
 ## `Ganesh` by using ## symbol

         Heading 3:
 ### `Ganesh` by using ### symbols

  These the the some of the example of heading files......





 `Emphasis:`
- - You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.


* `Strong emphasis`
* `Strike through`

Markdown documents can be easily converted to other formats like., 
* HTML 
* PDF
* online converters. 

This makes Markdown a popular choice for creating documentation, blogs, and other types of content that can be easily shared and published across different platforms.

# `History 0f Markdown`
  In 2004, the first iteration of Markdown was released, and authors, bloggers, and programmers soon adopted it. `Gruber published Markdown 1.0`, an upgraded version of the format, in `2006`. Several new features, such support for tables and footnotes, were incorporated in this version.

* Markdown has improved and changed throughout the years.
* Markdown was became the default markup language on the well-known code hosting website GitHub in 2010. 
*  This contributed to Markdown being more well-known and being used more often. 

## `Symbols used for Creating Markdown file:`
Markdown uses a number of symbols to create formatting and structure in text. Some of the most commonly used symbols in Markdown include:

-  `#`: Used to create headings. The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the heading 
    (e.g. # for  a top-level heading, ## for a second-level heading, and so on).

- `*` or `_`: Used to create emphasis or italic text. Surround a word or phrase with a single * or _ to italicize it, or with two to create bold text.

- `-` or + or `*`: Used to create unordered lists. Start a line with a dash (-), plus sign (+), or asterisk (*) followed by a space to create a new list item.

- `1.`: Used to create ordered lists. Start a line with a number followed by a period and a space to create a new list item.

- `>`: Used to create blockquotes. Start a line with a greater than symbol (>) followed by a space to create a blockquote.

- `[]`: Used to create links. Place the text you want to use as the link text in square brackets ([]), followed by the link URL in parentheses (()).

- `: Used to create inline code. Surround code with backticks to indicate that it should be displayed as code.
# `Creating a Markdown file:`
- These are just some of the symbols used in Markdown. There are many more, including symbols for creating tables, images, and more.
- Any text editor may be used to create a Markdown file, which is a straightforward procedure. These are the actions:

- A text editor should be launched, such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.

- Use the shortcut "Ctrl + N" (Windows) or "Cmd + N" (Mac) to create a new file by choosing "New" or "File" from the menu (Mac).

- Save the document with a.md extension, such as `"myfile.md."` The text editor is informed that it is a Markdown file thanks to this extension.

- Your Markdown file's content should now be written. To format your content, you may use different Markdown syntax, such as:

- - To make `headers`, use the `#` symbol (for example, `"This is a heading"`).
- - For `lists`, use the `*` or `-` symbols (such as `* Item 1, * Item 2`).
- - To make text `bold`, use `**` (such as this).

- To make `block quotes`, use `>` (for example, `> This is a quotation`).
- After you're done writing in your Markdown document, save it by clicking `"Save"` in the menu or by pressing `"Ctrl + S"` on a Windows or `"Cmd + S"` on a Mac (Mac).

- Now you may open the Markdown document in a Markdown viewer or use a Markdown converter to convert it to HTML or another format.
- > This is all about creating the Markdown file.

# `What is the purpose of a Markdown file?`

- Without using an official text editor or HTML tags, markdown is a simple markup language that may be used with plain text to add formatting elements `(headings, bulleted lists, and Links)`. 
- Markdown shows the writing format uniformly on all sorts of devices and is device independent.
